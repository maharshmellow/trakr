**Bug**
When the website is pinging the websites, any edits made on the website won't persist. This is because when pinging, I get all the data from the database, process it, update it, and push the changes back all at once. **This is easy to fix by just updating user by user but that would completely use up my free quota.** Since this is just a side project, I don't necessarily want to pay for this, so for the time being, this issue will not be fixed. So a ping for all the websites occurs every 10 minutes and during that pinging time, no changes will be saved.
